# Why Markdown? #

#### 1. Markdown is a language that you use to format elements to plain text documents. ####

#### 2. Markdown Syntax is designed to be readable even if it's not rendered. ####

 - To create a heading in Markdown  you use the pound key ranging from 1 to 6 in number. 
 - 1 Pound sign is the largest and 6 being the smallest.

 - To create italic text in the same manner only using one asterisk mark.
